# These are generated by Maven during the build process.
target/                  # Standard Maven build output directory
pom.xml.tag              # Maven internal file
pom.xml.releaseBackup    # Maven internal file
pom.xml.versionsBackup   # Maven internal file
pom.xml.next             # Maven internal file
release.properties       # Maven Release Plugin file
dependency-reduced-pom.xml # From Shade Plugin (if used)
build/                   # Another common build directory (e.g., if also using Gradle)

# 2. Eclipse Specific
# If anyone on your team uses Eclipse, these files are generated by the IDE.
.classpath

# 3. IntelliJ IDEA Specific

# 4. VS Code Specific
# Files generated by VS Code for workspace and settings.
.vscode/                 # Workspace settings directory
# Comment out the line below if you *want* to commit specific VS Code settings
# like launch configurations (.vscode/launch.json) or tasks (.vscode/tasks.json)
# *.code-workspace        # VS Code workspace files (if you open a multi-root workspace)
*.log                    # VS Code logs (e.g., extensions logs)

# 5. Compiled Java Files
# These are the bytecode files generated by the Java compiler.
*.class                  # All compiled Java class files

# 6. Jar / War / Ear files
# These are the packaged application files.
*.jar                    # Java Archive files
*.war                    # Web Archive files (not applicable for desktop, but good to include generally)

# 9. IDE-Specific Local Files (Generic)
# Sometimes IDEs create temporary or local files in the root.
*.swp                    # Vim swap files
*~                       # Backup files created by some editors

# 10. Maven Wrapper (Optional)
# If you use the Maven Wrapper (mvnw / mvnw.cmd), you typically commit the wrapper scripts
# but ignore the downloaded Maven distribution.
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
.mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java
# The actual Maven distribution downloaded by the wrapper
.mvn/wrapper/dist/

# 11. Custom/Temporary Files
# Any other files you know will be generated locally and should not be committed.
# For example, if your app saves user data or configuration files in the project root
# data/
# config.properties
