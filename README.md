![todoer - github banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67515f4e-ef6c-43f5-a042-a8534a5fddb4)
For our OOP class at Diponegoro University, the "Smart To-Do List" application provides a practical demonstration of core object-oriented programming principles. This desktop application, built with Java Swing, enables users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking them as complete. Key OOP concepts are implemented through well-defined classes such as Task (encapsulating task details like title, due date, and priority) and TaskManager (managing the collection of tasks), showcasing encapsulation, polymorphism through task categorization (e.g., PersonalTask, WorkTask), and abstraction in its persistence layer. The project offers an ideal learning experience, balancing functional complexity with clear adherence to OOP best practices.
